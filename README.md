# PitchPipe

A Java application simulating a pitch pipe for musical instrument tuning.  
This application was created using my own custom wav files.  

Each of the 12 buttons refers to a corresponding pitch in a chromatic scale. These buttons will
play a sound for the user to hear, based on the set options. Upon first opening the application,
these buttons will work using the default settings. For more information about the options, see
the next section.

The Pitch Pipe offers two sets of customizable options. The Octave option, found on the left,
allows the user to change between three octaves. ‘Octave 2’ is the octave of the Middle C on a
piano keyboard. The Pitch Pipe additionally offers one octave below Middle C (‘Octave 1’), and
one octave above Middle C (‘Octave 3’). The Tone option, found on the right, allows the user to
change between three different sounds for the desired pitch. These options are sine wave,
square wave, and saw wave. A sine wave is a pure tone with no added harmonics. A square
wave has a louder, brighter sound due to added odd harmonics. Lastly, a saw wave is the
loudest and brightest due to added odd and even harmonics.
